    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First thing I would recommend is to use secure authorizations and authentications which will ensure that the access to certain information will be limited to those who are authorized to view that information, like for example two-factor authentication. Then I would recommend removing any html markups such as "script", "link" and "object" , to defend the website against XSS attacks. The potential client also needs to display only information and data that they need, and  using vulnerability scanning tools to check the security of  the website. And lastly i would recommend sanitization of data.</p>
